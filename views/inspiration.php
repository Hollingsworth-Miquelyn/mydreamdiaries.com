            <h1>Inspiration for The Dream Diaries</h1>
            <p>The Dream Diaries are unlike anything I have written before. My 
            short stories ranged from thrillers and crime dramas to inspirational 
            and even religious, but never a fantasy action adventure from the 
            point-of-view of a 16 year old girl. I brainstorm often for new material. 
            During one such session in the summer of 2012, I thought how could someone 
            learn a great deal about something without knowing they've learned it? 
            From that rather bizarre question, The Dream Diaries were born. I hadn't 
            intended to write from the mind of Rorie Fletcher, but the story, as it 
            evolved, insisted upon it. There was no doubt that she was my protagonist 
            and that the world she was determined to save was unlike anything I had ever 
            dreamt of. This page will give an account of the inspiration behind 
            The Dream Diaries.</p>
