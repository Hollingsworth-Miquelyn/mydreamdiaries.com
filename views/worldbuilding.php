            <h1>World Building</h1>
            <p>World building is the most fun and most infuriating part of any new 
            story. Whether it's the relative reality of a detective story or the 
            creation of something completely unique, world building demands the 
            most creativity. Once the world is established and I know what characters
            are to interact in it, in simply a matter of letting the story play out.</p>
            <p>In The Dream Diaries we find a world somewhere between reality and 
                fantasy. Although none of the places or people ever existed, the 
                rules governing Rorie's dream world could have played out around 
                a set of undiscovered islands a few hundred years ago in our own 
                history. So, although it's a fictional world you won't find Hobbits 
                with rings or magical boarding schools. This allows the reader to 
                settle in and trust that that adventure they are about to go on 
                follows ruffly that same rules as our world. If Rorie trips and 
                falls she will skin her knee just you might. That being said I do 
                have plans for some characters that haven't ever existed in our world 
                and may never in the future. After all The Dream Diaries are a fantasy
                action adventure.</p>
