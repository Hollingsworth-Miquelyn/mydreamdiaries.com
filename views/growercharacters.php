            <p>The list below contains a description of the main characters of the Grower episodes.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Carise</dt>
                <dd>She is headstrong. She will say anything that she perceives 
                as truthful. She is disliked by the majority of her peers because
                she is perceived as an insufferable know-it-all. She fights often 
                with her younger brother, but will fiercely come to his aid.</dd>
                <dt>Geoff</dt>
                <dd>He is the younger brother of Carise. He is friendly, a risk taker,
                and liked by everyone but he as only a few close friends. He is often
                frustrated with his older sister but feels that she is unduly mistreated
                and excluded by the other kids.</dd>
                <dt>Dawn</dt>
                <dd>She is a pretty girl who feels that she isn't very smart. She
                idolizes Carise and believes she is the source of all information. 
                She would do anything to impress Carise.</dd>
                <dt>Jerek</dt>
                <dd>He is Geoff's best friend. He does his best to mirror the antics 
                and charisma of his best friend. He is jealous at the ease at which Geoff
                endears himself to everyone in the community.</dd>
