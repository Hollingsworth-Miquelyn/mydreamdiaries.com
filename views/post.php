        <h1>Surey - Grower Episode</h1>
        <p>The moment the Lawman grabbed me it was clear to both of us that I wasn’t going to struggle. I finally got a body I agreed with. No struggle usually meant less pain. I was pulled outside and thrown to the ground, so much for less pain. My attacker pressed his knee into my back, and I could feel that familiar feeling building. It wasn’t fear. Little kids might be scared of what’s behind the closet door, or when the monster jumps out at a monster movie, but when every night for almost three years have been this intense, the fear had long since been replaced. The knee in my back was meant to intimidate, to terrify, but it only fueled the feeling growing inside me.</p>
        <p>In the yard I saw several more like the creep on my back. They were the Lawmen, soldiers from the Citadel. A few were holding down the family, father, mother, son and me. I must be the daughter. Each of them were forced to the ground and held by the back of a shirt or by their hair as they knelt in front of their home; if you could call the one room, dirt floor, mud brick building a home. I could tell some of the Lawmen were still inside. The few meager possessions in the house were carelessly tossed out windows as the Lawmen searched.</p>
        <p>It wasn’t long before a tall sunburnt Lawman stepped from the hovel holding a dirty cloth filled with a few dozen pea pods. The family had stolen food. Peas were not part of the ration. The mother started to cry. One of the Lawmen standing in front produced a canister and breaking the seal unrolled a paper sewn inside.</p>
        <p>“By order of his honor, Governor Marcus Boggs,” he began in a high voice, “The duly appointed representative of the council of Citadel Elders decrees that if the perpetrator is found guilty of the crime or crimes listed below the punishment shall be a minimum of two-hundred lashes or up to and including death by hanging at the prerogative of the arresting official.”</p>
        <p>“That’s me,” an ugly man standing in the middle added sourly. “Four hundred lashes to be carried out immediately.”</p>
        <p>Another Lawman joined the one holding the father and lifted him to his feet. The father glanced instinctively at his oldest son but quickly recovered. His face was shielded from the Lawmen, but I saw the scared but dangerous look in his eye. His boy was maybe a few years younger than me. I looked him over and saw his fear. Realization dawned on me. The boy had stolen the peas.</p>  
        <p>No clear thinking person would steal an item not on the ration list; it must be the act of a desperate starving boy aching to help his family. I could see both the father and son were terrified that the Lawmen would arrive at the same conclusion.</p>
        <p>The father was walked to a post that stood four feet high and matched the posts that stood in front of every home. His hands were tied to the post in front of him. Once he was secured one of the Lawmen jerked at the back of his shirt and it tore away easily.</p>
        <p>“Mr. Crenshaw,” the ugly man said nonchalantly, “do your duty.”</p>
        <p>One man produced a bag and drew out the whip. It was made of several strands of leather that came together in a handle. The man widened his stance to get the leverage and brought the whip down hard.</p>
        <p>I was looking at the father when the first lash hit. He now was sure that the laziness of the Lawmen had over come common sense and that his son was safe. A brief smile flashed on his lips. It was gone by the second lash.</p>
        <p>I was held in the spot, unable to run. I was able to look away, but when I did I didn’t find the relief I had hoped for. The other two guards, realizing that no resistance was coming from either the man’s family or friends, threw the mother to the ground and joined others who were rifling threw the family’s things, pulling out clothes and objects, like the man under the lash was already dead. But no one would look twice at a Lawman stealing from a Grower family, especially not one under punishment.</p>
        <p>I closed my eyes and listened to a voice counting from one to four hundred. I opened my eyes as the last lash struck and to my amazement the father, who had slumped to his knees at some point during the beating, stood up. He walked away aided by two fiends that had appeared from nowhere, but had undoubtedly been watching from some hidden location. Then I heard a sound, a squishing like walking through mud. It came from the father’s shoes. The cuts from his back had run down his pants and filled in his shoes.</p>
        <p>Without warning the scene changed. I was still outside the one room dwelling, but night had fallen and erased any trace of the earlier savagery. Another search was going on, not in the house this time but in the surrounding dark fields. It was practically a silent search. Barely a whisper escaped the frantic looking faces that searched hopelessly in the dark. Understanding hit me like a fall of a ladder. These searchers were all Growers, and if they were found out of their homes after dark it meant immediate execution.</p>
        <p>I began to cry although it was ineffectual. No tears fell. No relief in the gasping. Just a constricting, dry, exhausted feeling. I could feel panic rising up in me. I felt like my arms and legs were tied down and I was trapped. Trapped in this horrible dream.</p>
        <p>Just when I thought I couldn’t handle any more, I was distracted. The father was walking back to the dwelling. He had his wife with him and was holding her against his chest to muffle the sound of her sobbing. I followed them inside and saw the two collapsed to the floor. The boy was missing. The boy who had stolen the peas had run away.</p>
        <p>“Surey,” the mother sobbed, “my little Surey.”</p>
        <p>“It’ll be okay, Mother,” the father whispered without any conviction.</p>
        <p>“Surey,” she continued, ignoring the father’s attempted to console her, “Surey, my little boy . . .”</p>
