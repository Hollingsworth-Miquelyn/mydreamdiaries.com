                <dd>She is a smart, confident girl who has no confidence in her 
                intelligence or her ability. She believes that if the dreams she has
                been having for the last three years would stop then she could fit
                in at school. She is about to be forced to learn who she really is
                and what she can really do.</dd>
                <dt>Said</dt>
                <dd>She is a strong willed yet understand natural leader. She believes
                in Rorie more than Rorie believes in herself. She is undeterred in her
                believe of the importance of their mission and will be the driving
                force until Rorie learns to believe in herself.</dd>
                <dt>Boyd</dt>
                <dd>He is a quiet doting loner. He is the son of a Regent, born to rule
                his people. Boyd is more capable than anyone gives him credit for. Although
                he may not come out and say what is on his mind, it is clear to anyone watching 
                where his motivation stems from and what his motives truly are.</dd>
                <dt>Uncle</dt>
                <dd>He is a literal giant of a man. He is Boyd's true uncle. Uncle is the name he
                goes by when visiting home. Uncle is at first the guide and body guard that helps 
                our travelers find their way in the world, but ultimately becomes a true believer 
                in Rorie's potential.</dd>
