            <h1>The Dream Diaries</h1>
            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>Rorie Fletch has to decide whether or not to trust the pirates. These
            are not the speedboat pirates she has heard of back home on the news, 
            but cannon-firing, cutlass-wearing, big-bearded pirates.</p>
            <p>At home she would have done anything to be normal, to rid herself of the
            years of haunting dreams she chronicles in her diaries. But when she is 
            whisked away by an unknown force to the land of her dreams and promised 
            that the dreams will stop if she delivers her diaries, her fear of fitting 
            in is replaced by old west gunfights, wagon hijacks and prison breaks.
            Rorie is joined by a group of assorted companions, who each have their 
            own reasons to follow, fight, and rebel.</p>
            <p>The controlling government is massing to deliver a devastating blow, 
                and the unknown force is anything but trustworthy.  This brings Rorie 
                to her current dilemma. Should she run and put her life and the lives
            of her trusted companions in the hands of blood thirsty pirates or stay and
            make a stand against the overwhelming power of the government?</p>
